# lightning-i18n-cldr-options

**What is it?**  
This component is designed to facilitate internal usage on the platform by providing localization options generated from the Localizer's i18n-cldr-options, maintained by the globalization team, enhancing the user's global experience.

**Where would you use it?**
- Imagine you're using a website that's based in a different country, and you want to see prices in your own currency. The <lightning-i18n-cldr-options> component could be used to convert those prices to your local currency.
- Suppose you're using an international website and you want to see dates and times in your own time zone. The <lightning-i18n-cldr-options> component could be used to adjust the dates and times to match your local time zone.
- Let's say you're using a website in a language that's not your first language, and you want to see the website in your own language. The <lightning-i18n-cldr-options> component could be used to translate the website to your preferred language.

This module gets generated from [Localizer's i18n-cldr-options](https://git.soma.salesforce.com/Globalization/localizerjs/tree/master/packages/%40localizer/i18n-cldr-options) which is maintained by the globalization team.

We then expose it as part of lightning for internal usage on the platform. This module is also part of our NPM distribution.
